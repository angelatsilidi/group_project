            It dates back to the 1930s when townsfolk began wearing masks to disguise their identity,
            slowing evolving over the years to become a general celebration in the
            hope of prosperity for the coming year. The festival begins the night before with
            the Masquerade Ball and continues until noon the following day when a Grand Parade
            goes through the town of Tuledo.
